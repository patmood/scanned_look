# Scanned Look

Upload your PDF or image and make it look like it's been scanned! Perfect for legitimizing digitally signed documents for old school beurocrats.

Scanned look will make your document black and white, a little blurry, and slightly rotated as though every page has been run through a scanner.

# How does it work?

- Web app is made with Node.js
- File is uploaded and each page is manipulated with Image Magik
- All pages are combined with Ghostscript
- 'Scanned' file is returned to user

## TODO:
- Handle 1 page documents
- Handle images as 1 page documents
- drag and drop upload
